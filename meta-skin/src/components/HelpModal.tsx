          <Typography>
            Meta Apps can be referred to Friends by Advocates who own it.
            Friends get 25% discount, whilst Advocates get some credit. The
            purpose of this website is to provide some matchmaking to help all
            sides get the best out of it.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="h6">üåç Where does it work?</Typography>
          <Typography>
            The confirmed regions so far are UK, ES, KR, NL and some US states.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="h6">üò• What data do you store?</Typography>
          <Typography>
            Your browser stores locally whether you have accepted these terms or
            not.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - As an Advocate, a simple Database stores your `username` and a
            list of the meta apps that you have saved. You can request this
            information to be deleted by sending an email via the following
            link:
          </Typography>
          <Link href="mailto:david.c.iglesias@gmail.com?subject=[Meta App Referrals] Please remove my username!&body=Hi, my username is: [write your username here] and I would like it removed from your Meta App Referrals App.Thank you.">

              <Email />
            </IconButton>
            david.c.iglesias@gmail.com
          </Link>
          <Typography>
            - As an Advocate, your id is saved once you save a link, to thwart
            attempts of saving links from someone else.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - As a Friend, nothing is saved. Whenever you click on a link you go
            directly to the Meta Oculus Store, no strings attached.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="h6">üí∏ Where is the profit?</Typography>
          <Typography>
            There is no profit here, at least for us! We simply hope to help
            everyone win (more apps sold, more people getting discounts and more
            people getting credit)
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="h6">üôè What do I agree to?</Typography>
          <Typography>As a User, you agree to the following:</Typography>
          <Typography>- Not tampering with the lottery process</Typography>
          <Typography>
            - Not using/sharing any of the referral links outside of this App
