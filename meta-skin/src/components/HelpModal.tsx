          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Meta Apps can be referred to Friends by Advocates who own it.
            Friends get 25% discount, whilst Advocates get some credit. The
            purpose of this website is to provide some matchmaking to help all
            sides get the best out of it.

          <Typography>
            - As a Friend, search for a desired game and click on the Get icon
            to get the discount, then buy the game within 7 days.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - As an Advocate, create your first link with the + button, and then
            search for other games you own and add them quickly from the table
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ paddingTop: 2 }}>
            ü§ì Are there any limits?
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            The confirmed regions so far are UK, ES, KR, NL and some US states.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - As a Friend, once you have accepted an invitation, you have 7 days
            to buy the game.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - As an Advocate, you will receive your credit 15 days after your
            Friend has bought the game (to avoid refunds).

          <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ paddingTop: 2 }}>
            üò• What data do you store?
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Your browser stores locally whether you have accepted these terms or
            not.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - As an Advocate, a simple Database stores your `username` and a
            list of the meta apps that you have saved. You can request this
            information to be deleted by sending an email via the following
            link:

          <Link

            - As an Advocate, your id is saved once you save a link, to thwart
            attempts of saving links from someone else.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            - As a Friend, the App ids you have clicked on are saved, but you
            can reset this from the Get column. Whenever you click on a link you
            go directly to the Meta Oculus Store, no strings attached.

          <Typography>
            There is no profit here, at least for us! We simply hope to help
            everyone win (more apps sold, more people getting discounts and more
            people getting credit)
