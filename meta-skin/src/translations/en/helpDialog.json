  "text": "<h6>ü§î What is this website for?</h6><p>Meta Apps can be referred to Friends by Advocates who own it. Friends get 25% discount, whilst Advocates get some credit. The purpose of this website is to provide some matchmaking to help all sides get the best out of it. The referrals are verified individually to ensure that the links are valid.</p><h6>üî® How to use this website?</h6><ul> <li> - As a Friend, search for a desired App and click on the Get icon to get the discount, then buy the App within 7 days. </li> <li> - As an Advocate, use the Oculus Mobile App to create a referral for the App from either the Store view or the Referral section, then come back to this site and paste your App referral in the dialog that will appear if you click on the +  button. Alternatively, find the App in the table and click the button in the `Add` column. Afterwards you can search for other Apps you own and add them quickly from the table </li></ul><h6>ü§ì Are there any limits?</h6><p>The confirmed regions so far are UK, ES, KR, NL and some US states.</p><ul> <li> - As a Friend, once you have accepted an invitation, you have 7 days to buy the App before it expires. Otherwise, you will need to request a new invitation. </li> <li> - As an Advocate, you will receive your credit 15 days after your Friend has bought the App (to avoid refunds). </li></ul><h6>üò• What data do you store?</h6><p>Your browser stores locally whether you have accepted these terms or not.</p><ul> <li> - As an Advocate, the Database stores your `username` and a list of the meta Apps that you have saved. You can request this information to be deleted by sending an email via the following link with proof of ownership of the account: </li></ul><a aria-label='email' href='mailto:david.c.iglesias@gmail.com?subject=[Meta App Referrals] Please remove my username!&body=Hi, my username is: [write your username here] and I would like it removed from your Meta App Referrals App.Thank you.'> <button aria-label='email button'><email/></button> david.c.iglesias@gmail.com</a><ul> <li> - As an Advocate, your username is saved once you save a link, to thwart attempts of saving links from someone else. </li> <li> - As a Friend, the App ids you have clicked on are saved, but you can reset this from the Get column. Whenever you click on a link you go directly to the Meta Oculus Store, no strings attached. </li></ul><h6>üí∏ Where is the profit?</h6><p> There is no profit here, at least for us! We simply hope to help everyone win (more Apps sold, more people getting discounts and more people getting credit)</p><h6>üôè What do I agree to?</h6><p>As a User, you agree to the following:</p><ul> <li>- Not tampering with the lottery process</li> <li>- Not using/sharing any of the referral links outside of this App</li> <li>- Not saving any of referral links in the App outside of your own</li></ul>",
