# Meta Dog - Referral Lottery

## Introduction

### Concepts

- App: Any of the Meta Apps that are listed in the Oculus Store. They must be above a certain price to be eligible (10€ in EU)
- Region of Application (as of September 2022): UK, NL, ES, KR, US (limited)

### Personas

- **Advocates** - Users who refer **Apps** to **Friends** - They receive 5$/5€/4£ of credit 14 days after a Friend has bought the referred **App**.
- **Friends** - Users who accept **App** referrals from **Advocates** to receive a 25% discount on an App

A User acts as **Advocate** if they are offering referrals and as a **Friend** if they are seeking referrals.

### How tos

- How to become an **Advocate**: from the Oculus App, navigate to an **App** you own, click on the three dots and then `Send referral link`. Alternatively, you can use the `App Referral` tab from the Referrals' section
- How to become a **Friend**: receive a link from an **Advocate**, accept it, then find the game in the Oculus Store (web or Oculus App) and buy it. You should see your discount applied automatically; otherwise, use the code `FRIEND`.

### Why?

- Because I like having easy access to referrals and I like to share! A bit of extra credit never hurts too, and forums/reddit are full of people trying to get referrals by downvoting others etc, so I hope this provides a better environment where everybody wins

### I want to buy you a coffee!

I love coffee, but I am not doing this for money :) Please donate money to your favorite charity!
